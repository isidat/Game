Game (has no name yet)
====

Game is an awesome open-source strategy game build in Javascript. Here are some features:

Isometric, tile based mapping like Age of Empires. SheetEngine Javascript library is used. This library is awesome too because it runs on HTML5 (cross-platform), is quite understandable and has some cool effects build-in like shadows, dimming different than other game engines.
	
The players make economy, get power and attack other players (or more peacefully trade with them) while it defends itself from them and mother nature.
	
To be honest the Game has not been shaped in my mind completely. I (and maybe willing contributers) will shape it and add lots of cool feature while coding.
